# Talking to Servers (sending requests) with JavaScript

### SWBATS:
* Use [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to get data from servers (API's).
* Use [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to set up a dummy server.
* Learn the difference between arrow functions and function expressions.
### Nice to knows:
* What is node?
* asynchronous vs synchronous JavaScript code.

## Node.js
A run-time environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code on your computer (not just on the browser). JavaScript code that is running on your computer (with the help of Node) has access to your file system. Node can be used as a:

* web server (listen to incoming requests similar to Rack)
* task-runner (similar to Rake)

### npm (node packake manager)
Similar to bundler in ruby, npm helps manage javascript libraries for your projects. `json-server` is an example of one such library. We will learn how to create a RESTful-CRUD-JSON api with rails soon. But for now, we can make a simple server using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
