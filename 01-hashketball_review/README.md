### How to participate in lecture
* Don’t wait for the answer, make a hypothesis based on the context and knowledge you have so far.
* Don’t be afraid to give the wrong answer.
* If you get tired or sleepy, do whatever it takes to stay awake.

### RSPEC and TDD
* Most of our labs have tests, use them to guide you.
* Get a birds-eye view of the lab by reading through the readme and then running rspec.
* Once you have a high level picture, work through the errors / failed tests one-by-one using rspec —fail-fast.

### Data Types

* Integers
* Boolean

    * indices
    * how to access something.

* talk about symbols briefly
```ruby

    # merge the teams
    # take the home players and the away players and put them into a new array 
    binding.pry




    # get the player by name
    # use the payer’s hash, fetch their points
end
```

* break large problems into small problems
* get quick feedback loop (code something, try it out)

### find_player(player_name)
