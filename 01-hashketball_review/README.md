# Hashketball Review

### How to participate in lecture:
* Don't wait for the answer, make a hypothesis based on the context and knowledge you have so far.
* Don't be afraid to give the wrong answer.
* If you get tired or sleepy, do whatever it takes to stay awake.

### RSPEC and TDD
* Most of our labs have tests, use them to guide you.
* Get a birds-eye view of the lab by reading through the readme and then running `rspec`.
* Once you have a high level picture work through the errors one-by-one using `rspec --fail-fast`.

### Data Types
* Strings
* Integers
* Boolean
* Arrays
* Hash

### binding.pry

### Methods in ruby
* Implicit return
* Explicit return

### #game_hash method
* talk about symbols briefly

### #number_points_scored
* break large problems into small problems
* get quick feedback loop (code something, try it out)
