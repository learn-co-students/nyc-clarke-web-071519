Earlier we were introduced to SQL. We saw how powerful and fast it can be for managing and interacting with data. How can we take advantage of this in Ruby? - Enter ORMS (Object Relational Mappers) - Transforming data into objects and visa versa.

For example - a Tea app
* CRUD - create read update delete

## ActiveRecord
ORM library that we're going to use for ruby.

* Help us manage our database schema.
 * Migrations

* Have models that can communicate with the database.

* rake - task manager
