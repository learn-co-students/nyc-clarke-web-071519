    "Jasmine Tea", 
    "Jasmine tea is a tea which is scented with jasmine flowers. The jasmine flavor is added either by blending the blossoms with the tea or by steaming tea in jasmine flavor. The jasmine blossoms are removed by hand as soon the jasmine flavor is absorbed by the tea. High quality jasmine tea is blended up to seven times with fresh jasmine blossoms. Blending tea with flowers was originally used to upgrade lower quality teas. Today, jasmine tea is considered a tea specialty. However, there are different quality levels produced and sold. The decisive factor for the quality, in addition to the selection of tea and jasmine blossoms, is the number of blending of the tea with jasmine blossoms."

    "Green Tea",
    "Made from the leaves of Camellia sinensis that have undergone minimal oxidation during processing. Green tea originates in China, but it has become associated with many cultures throughout Asia. According to a survey released by the United States Department of Agriculture in 2007, the mean content of flavonoids in a cup of green tea is higher than that in the same volume of other food and drink items that are traditionally considered of health contributing nature, including fresh fruits, vegetable juices or wine. Flavonoids are a group of phytochemicals in most plant products that are responsible for such health effects as anti-oxidative and anticarcinogenic functions."
